This is an Example WebApp to show the integration with hosted JS and Navigator xAPI access to control the Navigator LEDs.

If JSXAPI is allowed you will be able to control the LEDs on the Navigator.
<br>The top Left will tell you if JSXAPI is active and what color the LED has been changed to.<br/>
The color status starts with "Checking stuff and things".
